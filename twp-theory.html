        Trash can be a reflection of the self, both physically and psychologically. What we throw away signifies something about what we had, what we used, how we used it, and why we threw it away. What it implies and what can be taken from it is the subject of various studies, both scientific and cultural, and also through a more reformative, artistic lens. I began a personal exploration of my own trash to observe my own patterns of use and disposal, and by narrowing down a choice few items, see how I can be viewed from an outside perspective. Through this project, I hope to view my trash in an objective way, expanding my thinking on waste and the importance of what I use, and figure out ways I can reuse what I throw away.

      <br>
      <br>
            As an artist, a graphic designer to be specific, I often find patterns and beauty in a variety of things. Using trash in art is not a new concept, and in the modern art world, artists are finding ways to use trash not only as a physical material to make the art itself but also imbue meaning into it— what does trash tell you about the world? How can it represent a certain individual? What does it mean in the context of this post-industrial society? In an article by Vik Muniz, a contemporary artist who recycled garbage from a landfill outside Rio de Janeiro named Jardim Gramacho into portraits of the people who lived and worked there, he states that “Artworks are tools we can use to challenge our often-anesthetized connection to the past, as well as to help us frame our view of the present.” I find this to be in conversation with an article by Sarah Newman, an archaeologist who is working to reframe the history of waste and “claims that waste—what we deem “unwanted”—is a relatively recent idea.” Newman wants to “unmake the idea that [trash] is an inevitable part of human life” and not use it as an excuse for the amount of waste we produce today. We view the past as something that has always contained trash, so we don’t give much thought to it, which has helped lead us to where we are today and the abundance of needless garbage that sits in landfills. By making artwork with trash, we can recontextualize and draw attention to different ways we can reuse it, what it can represent about time and culture. 

            <br><br>
        Muniz also mentions how working with individuals making artwork from trash "gave [him] a new awareness of the importance of the artwork within a universal system of objects." In relation to my current project, creating this trash project is like an artistic documentation of my own self. It’s not in the same way Muniz creates a illustrative portrait, but more of an archival or informational piece of work. As a graphic designer, information is a big part of the artistic process for me, so in a way I see it as my own way of communicating through using waste.
        In my items, I include all physical objects, which is intentionally connected by their use as a self-care item. I mean this in both a mental and physical way: this ranges from headphones and my relationship with music as something I enjoy, to a piece of face mask packaging, something that I use to treat my skin. In another perspective of viewing different types of trash, Brian Thill writes about digital waste, and mentions that “that in this digital age, there are “hundreds of objects and ideas and people compete for our constantly stretched attention.” Despite this, our personal digital waste can be a good thing, as he describes that “these digital midden-heaps are major aides to memory, to new forms of journal-keeping, self-discovery, and self-rediscovery.” My project aims to be something similar, an artwork of a journalistic nature, something that catalogues data and memory while also holding meaning. Digitally, I believe Thill means it in what you save, meaning held in the way you type, the reason you saved a post, why you bookmarked an article focusing on an interest of yours. But this can also apply to physical waste. This material allows me to have a richer memory of time and a detailed history of change. I find value in what I’ve forgotten that I used and threw away.
        <br><br>
        But what comes after the collection of waste and the documentation of it? Getting rid of trash has always been a tricky subject. For many, once it’s out of their sight, it’s forgotten forever. Creating a digital project like this brings light to a few items I threw away, but what comes after its completion is probably that it ends up in the trash again. This “out of sight, out of mind” concept is addressed and criticized by the artists Tim Noble and Sue Webster, two British artists that use waste like plastic bottles and scrap metal to assemble art pieces that when the light is shined on it in a particular way way, very detailed shadows that depict human portraits appear on the wall. A shadow isn’t a physical object, which reflects the way in which after the physical trash is gone from one’s sight, it fades away. Their second major shadow piece, Dirty White Trash (with Gulls), 1998, features “the artists relaxing against each other with a cigarette and a glass of wine. This work was sculpted out of the trash produced by the artists over a six month period, serving as a placeholder for everything they needed to survive while they constructed the piece.” Here, trash is again used as a way to create a portrait of the self, this time through shadow and light, and the disconnect that comes as a result of the play between the physical items and the shadow is what illustrates our own disconnection with trash as a society. When thinking about my own project, making my items into a physical piece of artwork through techniques like collage could be possible.
        <br><br>
        But again: what happens after this documentation, its reuse and eventual disposal? I can’t recommend a simple solution, and waste management and recycling are pressing issues that many are currently working to solve today. In a paper that discusses the current practices of plastic waste management, “one widely cited study by Geyer et al. [25] estimates that by 2050, approximately 12 billion metric tons of plastic waste will have been generated, of which 8.3 billion metric tons will have ended up in landfills or the natural environment.” As the world’s third major contributor to waste, this problem isn’t going away anytime soon. Small-scale projects like my online trash collection can help bring awareness to the problems of our waste, but the power of real change really lies in the hands of policy makers and plastic manufacturers, who can then encourage change with the general public through less plastic use and increased recyling. Recycling is a leading solution, as it “is a good option for PWM to use the limited resources and minimize the impacts on the environment. The recycling process includes primary recycling, secondary recycling (mechanical recycling), tertiary recycling (chemical recycling), and quaternary recycling (energy recovery) [39]...It helps conserve resources, reduce energy consumption, and minimize the carbon footprint associated with plastic production.” Landfilling has a major impact on soil and groundwater, and incineration raises concerns about air pollution. Reusing plastic waste resourcefully is not the the be-all and end-all of solving waste management, but reflects the same ideas we see in trash studies and the art made from it.
