        <h2 id="sec-preface">Preface</h2>
        <p> In this project, I decided to record my trash as a way to see what I regularly dispose and if there are any common patterns within. It also reflects what I do along with my personality and preferences, whether this is through the products I tend to use, brands I buy, or diet I had that week.
          <br> <br>
          Your trash can be seen as a reflection of yourself, physically and mentally. If you look through someone’s trash, which is what this project is doing in a cleaner, more consise way, you can learn a lot about their life. Sometimes, this could even contain sensitive information, which is why paper shredders are used for financial or legal documents that are thrown away.
          Putting a record of trash on display like this allows me to view myself from a different perspective, one in the eyes of someone unfamiliar. Given only these details, what sort of impression does it give off to people?
          <br> <br>
          Reconsidering trash as something to be studied and documented is an interesting process. This can act as an archive, but also something more personal and journalistic. I hope to present it in a way that is not overly analytical and something that feels more inquisitive.

        <h2 id="sec-overview">Overview</h2>
        <p> In this week’s record of trash, I decided to focus on items I threw away that were related to my routines of self-care and maintenance. This includes both physical and mental care, which is how some people view the difference between the words care and maintenance. Either way, these are items that I had used for myself in some type of beneficial way. Everyone takes care of themself differently, and with the way trash can reflect on your tendencies and personality, displaying a specific collection of items I use for this is one way I present myself outwardly.
          Something I noticed about this was that for the most part, these items were thrown away as they where, not crumpled up or dramatically destroyed. 
          The items include an <a href="https://www.hellosunroom.com/shop/monthly-flyer-club">envelope</a>, 
          <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.drjart.com/product/28256/130648/masks/vital-hydra-solutiontm-glow-face-mask-with-hyaluronic-acid&ved=2ahUKEwjC1-bV39yLAxUnlJUCHUgPGHoQFnoECBUQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1OPDW0fBJsTAIHmV__ag-Y">face mask packaging</a>,

              and <a href="https://www.jnjvisionpro.com/en-us/products/acuvue-oasys-2-week-astigmatism/">contact lens packaging</a>. They can be divided into the following categories:<br>
          </p>

<div class="themes">
<div class="Single-use Packaging">
    <h3>★ Single-use Packaging</h3>
    <p>Both the face mask and contact lens I used were packaged with a single use plastic material. The cloth face mask itself had a plastic backing to help maintain its shape and make it easier to unfold for the user, which is the part that is included in the project. 
      It is white, thin, and as light as paper. I was given this set of moisturizing face masks from my mom, who naturally has a lot of skincare products on hand, as a way to take care of my skin. I remember the stark coldness of the mask on my face, 
      and the way I had to peel the plastic film off the back once the other side was plastered to my face. <br><br>
      As for the contact lens packaging, the lenses are packed in a small plastic case that contains a bit of contact solution so that the lens stays wet. Once opened, there’s no need for the packaging, as I then transfer the lenses to a more permanent 
      plastic case thats meant to store and cleanse them on a daily basis. The packaging of the contacts can be tricky, as sometimes the solution will spill out at you if you open it at an inconvenient angle.</p>
</div>
<div class="Smells">
  <h3>★ Smells</h3>
  <p>Both the empty spray bottle and Altoids tin contained something that was made to smell, 
    usually to improve a scent. The spray bottle contained a light, peach scent, which was used on myself, my clothes, and in my room. The bottle is cylindrical with a clear base and black cap and nozzle. 
    I got it my freshman year of high school because I had wanted a scent that was not too pungent, natural, and fresh. While it lasted a surprisingly long time, I get a feeling that reminds me of those years, though not any specific memories. 
    <br><br>
    The Altoids tin used to contain mints. The tin itself is red, white, and silver, with strong branding and typography. I got it a few months ago to keep on hand in order to smell fresh. 
    I remember hearing the mints clanging around in the tin in my backpack a lot. Eventually I finished all the mints and couldn’t really think of anything to reuse it for, so I recycled it.</p>
</div>
<div class="Creativity">
  <h3>★ Creativity</h3>
  <p>Creativity is a broad word, but for this category I mean it in reference to art and music. 
    The first item is an envelope that contained a risograph art print, sent by a subscription service I signed up for where every month a letter size 
    print is sent to my house. The envelope is a bright yellow, with their branding text and stamp. I got it in January as it held the first print of 2025.
     I love risograph prints and the studio has a unique design style, so I took the print out to hang on my wall, leaving the envelope with no purpose. 
     <br><br>
    Next, I threw away a small paper craft bag that held a gift my friend Franky gave me. She made a small DIY paper bag and tied it closed with a blue checkered ribbon,
     and decorated it with my name and a small frog illustration with colored pencil. The bag contained a small Snoopy keychain, which is a character I love, 
     so opening the bag and finding the gift within was a fun experience.
     <br><br>
    I also threw away an old pair of wired headphones that was severely fraying at the end. The headphones are an old Apple model, and the ending where it’s splitting show green and red wires inside the main cord. I got it with my old iPhone from middle school, and I’ve listened to countless hours and discovered all kinds of music through them. Unfortunately, with my wireless upgrades and the fraying wire, I had to let them go.</p>
</div>
<div class="Travel Bag Essentials">
  <h3>★ Travel Bag Essentials</h3>
  <p>Both items are typical essentials when travelling, no matter the distance. I threw away an empty ibuprofen bottle and a cut up debit card. The bottle is white and blue with generic branding, 
    and I bought it in the case of any headaches or pains I had. The inside of the bottle still strongly smells of the drug.
    <br><br>
    I also threw away my old debit card, and cut it up for security reasons beforehand. The design is a orange and purple ombre that faintly glitters, with my credit union’s logo. 
    I got it sometime between my senior year of high school and the beginning of my freshman year at Rutgers as a way to keep my own money in a personal banking account. 
    A memorable experience I had was actually the reason I had to throw it away, which was that somehow the card number got stolen and I was alerted by my bank of a suspicious charge, which led me to deactivate the card.</p>

<h2 id="sec-week">Item of the Week</h2>
<h3 id="intro"> ★ Altoids tin </h3>
<p>I’ve selected the Altoids tin as this item feels the most reusable, which is what they’re known for. The tin itself is small and compact, and the lid’s design and material make it feel vintage. If you look online, there are hundreds of ways people have been creative with their empty tins, using it as a compact mirror, to hold all sorts of trinkets, oil painting kits, and more. I bought it to keep in my backpack to have on hand whenever I wanted a mint, whether that be after a garlickly meal or bored and hungry in class. Eventually, I had finished all the mints, and I was left with the empty tin. I didn’t want to immediately throw it away as I’d seen all the ways people usually reused the tins online. I ended up reusing it as a coin holder, storing all the state quarters separately from my other coins. However, a problem with the tin was that whatever inside clanged against the metal, so when I started keeping all types of coins in it, keeping it in my backpack or tote bag got too noisy. I didn’t really have any other uses for the tin, so after I transferred my coins to a pouch, I decided to recycle it.
  The tins are manufactured at the Mars Wrigley Confectionery production plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The factory produces all of the Altoids large tins in the U.S., according to Jason Schierling, the Chattanooga site director. Production of Altoids moved from Wales to Chattanooga as a way to manufacture the products closer to its primary market. The mints were invented in 1780 and introduced to the U.S. in 1918, and originally made to relieve intestinal discomfort. As for the tin itself, it seems to be made of steel, or some other kind of metal combination. <a href="https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2018/mar/01/brand-altoids/">Source</a>

  <p>Overall, I felt my trash for this week reflected parts of myself, even as they ranged in specificity. Even the most basic item can tell you more about someone. Thank you for taking the time to read through my collection! Come back another week to see how my trash has changed.</p>
